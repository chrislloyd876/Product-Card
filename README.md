### What I learned

I think i'm beginning to understand reshaping elements. However, i'm still making mistakes where inheritance from the parent element is concerned.

I also learned about the picture element though I am still unable to use it without making the website crash. I will have to stick to media queries for now.


To see how you can add code snippets, see below:


```css
@media (max-width:32rem) {
    .product {
      flex-direction: column;
    }

    .image-desktop {
        display: none;
      }
  
      .image-mobile {
        display: block;
      }
  }
```

### Continued development

I still want to learn how to reshape my display to make it seem more uniformed. I'm still getting measurements wrong and everything is mostly too large
as compared to the actual solution.
I also need to understand Responsive Web Design a bit more. I still feel I'm not getting the basics right.
